# Dataview CLI
Dataview CLI brings data visualization to the command line.

Visualizing data directly in the command line can be easier, especially during development. Dataview helps developers visualize data so nobody has to read through 2000 chars ever again to find errors in the JSON string. Dataview gets built only with Unicode characters. Baybe I also will make custom characters to make lines for line graphs.
